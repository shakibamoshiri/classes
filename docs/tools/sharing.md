# :material-share-variant: Sharing Sessions

## if I record

If I record any session, they will be available privately on [class.shakiba.net](https://class.shakiba.net)


## if your record

It is recommended to record all your **real interviews** and later share them with 
me to check and review and give you feedback about.

To share them you can use :material-google-drive: Google Drive or any other 
platform you are comfortable with 


!!! warning
    If you prefer :material-google-drive: Google Drive, either you should make your 
    file **public** or give me (my Gamil account) address, access to, so I can 
    watch/download the file

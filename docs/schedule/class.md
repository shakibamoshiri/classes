# :material-google-classroom: Class

## Meeting Platform

Classes are held on :simple-googlemeet: Google Meet, See [Links > Meeting](links/meeting/)

## Classes' Time

Each session is 30 minutes to ensure effectiveness and manageability by students 
but it does not mean 60 minutes are not possible, if you are sure you can participate 
and stay 60 minutes without being tired, we go with 1h class.

!!! info
    One hour English classes for non-native speakers are tiring thus I found 
    reducing classes' time make it better

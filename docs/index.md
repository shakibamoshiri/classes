# :material-human-greeting-variant: Hi

## Me

This is **Shakib**, along with software development and operation, I have been 
an education mentor since 2020, teaching, training and mentoring junior developers, 
linux admins as well as **English** classes to boost their ESL skills.

So if you are working in IT and Software Development industry you have come to 
the very right place, I am doing what you are doing; coding, debugging, etc


## You

Have you ever been in a class that your teacher was reading a story, or a grammar 
book to you? **We are not going to do this.** We do not waste your time reading a 
book in our classes. We totally focus on what maters the most and covers your need.

## Why most speaking classes suck
If you have seen yourself in these conditions and situations then the classes 
you have for **speaking** are not going to help you really :|

- the teacher is reading from a text book
- the teacher is reading grammar book to you
- the teacher is reading words/terms form a book
- the teacher plays some video/audio files in the classes and you are listing
- the teacher did  not have a roadmap for you
- the teacher does not allow you recording your classes

!!! warning
    Any of above sings show ineffectiveness in your speaking class. Any of non-speaking 
    activities relevant to speaking should be done outside of the classes and in the 
    class time your total focus should be on speaking and listing.
